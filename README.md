# Amazon Bedrock Models Integration

This project integrates Amazon Bedrock models (DeepSeek, Claude, Mistral) into a Flask web application.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have the necessary AWS permissions for Amazon Bedrock.
2. Configure your AWS credentials using AWS CLI or environment variables.
Create a dedicated user in AWS.
Add bedrock policy
Create access key
Then copy access key in Â¯/.aws/credentials
```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id=ABCDEFG
aws_secret_access_key=MY_SECRET
```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install flask boto3
   ```

## Files

- `app.py` - Flask web application
- `bedrock_models.py` - Modular implementation of different Bedrock models
- `model_config.json` - Configuration for available models
- `test_models.py` - Script to test models individually

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. Test models individually:
   ```
   python test_models.py
   ```

## Switching Models

The application supports switching between different models:
- DeepSeek
- Claude
- Mistral

You can configure which models are available in the `model_config.json` file.
